# Fire Scar Detection Using Prithvi_ViT_100
 
We trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated the **Prithvi_ViT_100** model on the **Fire_Scar** dataset. We utilized **Weights and Biases (wandb)** for tracking accuracy scores and losses, and calculated the **Intersection over Union (IoU)** metric to compare the model's predictions with the ground truth masks.

## Hackathon Evaluation Requirements

Participants must provide the following:

### 1. **Training Notebook:**

- A Jupyter Notebook for model training.
- Must include the trained model weights, logs, and metrics.
- Ensure the notebook is easy to run and well-documented for the judges.

### 2. **Model Improvement Documentation:**

- A comprehensive list of attempts to improve model performance.
- Include results and explanations for each attempt.
- Judges will evaluate the effort, decision-making process, and final results.

### 3. **Performance Metrics Calculation:**

- **Metric:** Intersection over Union (IoU).
- Use the formula:

  $$ \text{IoU} = \frac{\text{True Positive}}{\text{True Positive} + \text{False Positive} + \text{False Negative}} $$

- Refer to `inference_terratorch.ipynb` for model testing details.

### 4. **Inference Notebook:**

- A Jupyter Notebook for running model inference.
- The test dataset will not be provided but will follow the same format as the training/validation data.
- Ensure all inference steps are clearly shown and easy to follow.
- The notebook will be used by judges to calculate the IoU score with a held-out set of data (expect less than 100% accuracy).

### 5. **TerraTorch Documentation:**

- Refer to `config_explainer.md` for detailed configuration explanations.
- Understand the configuration for potential model improvements.
- Use the **TerraTorch Quick Start documentation** to run model inference and understand configuration options.

## Metric Used: IoU Calculation

The **Intersection over Union (IoU)** was used as the primary performance metric to evaluate the model's segmentation accuracy. The formula for IoU is:

$$ \text{IoU} = \frac{\text{True Positive}}{\text{True Positive} + \text{False Positive} + \text{False Negative}} $$
